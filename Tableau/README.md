## Project 1: Bank Churn Dashboard
This Tableau dashboard offers a detailed exploration of customer churn. Users can interact with data to gain valuable insights into churn trends based on gender, age, balance, credit score, and country. The dashboard is designed to help businesses develop data-driven retention strategies by identifying at-risk customers and understanding key factors that influence churn. The interface was designed in Figma to optimize user experience and interactivity.
